  Water Pollution
  </div>

<p class= "intro2">
Sea-level shifts are converting coastlines and undermining buildings,
which poses a threat to the environment. Nowadays, people tend to invest in water filters.
This is great because in the long run, itâ€™s affordable and better for us. Today, more than
half of our population relies on groundwater for safe drinking water. In Antartica, most of
the global regions are melting and filling into the ocean. This can easily cause restrictions
 upon our water-usage. Today among several cities, more than 3,000 million people, face extremely
 high water stress/shortages.

    The pie chart on the left indicates the percentages of major pollutants that enter the oceans
     water. The three major causes of water pollution is due to sewage, offshore oil, and air
     pollutants. Sewage released into water may introduce dangerous pathogens or other disease
      eating organisms. Litter includes paper, plastic, and waste which creates hazardous waste.
      This affects our environment, because it leads to contamination of lakes, streams, oceans,
      and groundwater.
