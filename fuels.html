  Fossil Fuels
  </div>


<div class="intro2"><p>
  Almost 85% of the U.S. energy supply comes from coal, oil, and natural gases. These are all fossil fuels.
  These take more than a thousand years to form and they are not renewable. The population can do many things
   to conserve energy. You can do things such as turning off the lights when a room is not in use and replacing your light bulbs with fluorescent light bulbs. Use reusable glass plates and cups. When shopping, you can buy post-consumer manufactured goods made from recyclable material. Instead of driving to work/school, ride a bike or walk. This helps to conserve our fossil fuels. You should also avoid using nylon, instead you should use natural fibers. Another way to conserve fossil fuels is to power your home with solar energy.

Our land-use offsets 11% of these greenhouse gas emissions. These greenhouse gases
 trap all of the heat, which then makes the planet warmer. One of the largest substitutes
 in greenhouse gases are caused from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and
 transportation. According to the graph, transportation is the highest substitute. It is also
 formed by petroleum, which include gasoline and diesel.

This pie chart demonstrates developed countries and major emerging economy nations
 and their lead in carbon dioxide emissions. The more developed the country is, the higher
 the carbon dioxide emission is released. Everywhere in the world emits different amounts of
 greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
