  Fossil Fuels
  </div>


<div class="intro2"><p>
Almost 85% of the U.S. energy supply comes from coal, oil, and natural gases. These fossil fuels take more than a thousand years to form and they are not renewable. The population can do many things to conserve energy. You can do things such as turning off the lights when a room is not in use and replacing your light bulbs with LED light bulbs. Use reusable glass plates and cups. When shopping, you can buy post-consumer manufactured goods made from recyclable material. Instead of driving to work/school, ride a bike or walk. This helps to conserve our fossil fuels. You should also avoid using nylon, instead you should use natural fibers. Another way to conserve fossil fuels is to power your home with solar energy.

Our land-use offsets 11% of these greenhouse gas emissions. These greenhouse gases trap all of the heat, which then makes the planet warmer. One of the largest substitutes in greenhouse gases are caused from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. According to the graph, transportation is the highest substitute. It is also formed by petroleum, which includes gasoline and diesel.

This pie chart shows that four countries are emitting more than half of all carbon dioxide from fuel
combustion. Developed nations usually have a
higher carbon dioxide emissions rate. However, developing nations are leading in the growth
 of carbon dioxide emissions.
