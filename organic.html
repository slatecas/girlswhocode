  Organic Waste
  </div>
<br />

  <p class= "intro2">
You’re probably someone who goes to the grocery store and gets more items than what they need.
 Organic waste is something that is biodegradable which either comes from a plant or an animal.
  Organic waste is known to be broken down by other organisms over time. Buying too much food can
  definitely affect climate change. A way to prevent that, is to only buy what you need. You
  should also think about using your freezer, to store and preserve food that you won’t use for
   a while. In America, leftovers are usually thrown away, creating food waste. We desperately
  need to stop this issue. Leftovers can be used for work or school, especially if you’re late for
   either. Another way to prevent organic waste, is to limit your food. You should limit your diet
    to vegetables, fruits, rice, beans, etc. Notice that meat isn’t on the list, the reason being is
    because of meat waste. Meat waste is generally worse than vegetable waste. Today, ⅓ of all the
    food in the world is going to waste. All of the food going to waste could be enough calories to
    feed every undernourished person on Earth.

EPA estimated food from residential and commercial sources using data from sampling
 studies in various parts of the country in combination with demographic data on
 population, grocery store sales, restaurant sales, numbers of employees, and numbers
  of students, patients and prisoners in institutions. Composting data was from state
  environmental agency websites. Source: EPA

Organic Waste:
These studies provide us with equations that expresses generation rates which, when
paired with industry business statistics, it results in national annual food waste generation
 rates. This estimates 60.0 million tons of food waste will be generated in 2020, or more,
 if we don’t provide for our environment.
