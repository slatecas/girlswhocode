<strong>Bio:</strong>
	I am from Copperstown, New York. When I was four I moved to Hawley, Pennsylvania.
  Hawley is a small town by Scranton, PA. It is located by Lake Wallenpaupack, which is a popular tourist destination.
  I am going into eleventh grade this year. I am looking forward to starting college visits and starting to plan for my future.
  My favorite subjects in school are math and Spanish.</p>
