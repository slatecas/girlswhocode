<strong>What is climate change?</strong>
  According to the BBC, the planet's climate has rapidly been changing over time.
   Today, the global average temperature ranges around 15C, though thorough evidence suggests
   it has been much higher and lower in the past. However, the current period of global warming
   is occurring more quickly than many past events. Scientists are concerned that the natural alteration
   is being overrun by a constant human-induced warming that has serious entanglements for the stability of
   Earthâ€™s climate.

The greenhouse effect refers to the way the Earth's atmosphere, confines some of the energy from the Sun.
   Solar energy radiating back out to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse
   gases and re-emitted in all directions. The energy that radiates back down to Earth, heats both the lower
   atmosphere and the surface. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder, making our planet
    hostile to life.
