<strong>What is climate change?</strong>
Today, climate change is one of the most severe problems in the world. According to
National Geographic, 11% of global greenhouse gases are caused by deforestation. Around
800 million people are currently vulnerable to climate change. These can range from droughts,
 floods, heatwaves, and other significant amounts of natural disasters.
Do you wonder about how much money it would take the U.S. to make the changes that our
environment needs? Well, the answer is $140 billion per year. Now, although it may sound like
a lot of money, it’s really not. It’s actually less than 0.1% of the global gross domestic product,
otherwise known as the GDP. Our goal is to gain your attention and your help.
